Max_Points Project Schema:

- User (userID, fname, lname, username, password)
- Card_Ownership (userID, cardID)
	- Composite Primary Key is userID and cardID
	- Foreign Key cardID references Card
- Card (cardID, name)
- Category (cardID, value, multiplier)
	- Composite Primary Key is cardID and value
	- Foreign Key cardID references Card

The User table is for the users. The Card_Ownsership table links which users have which cards.
The Card table is for the cards. The Category table links which cards have which benefits and
their respective multipliers.

The User table represents a user of the app. The Card_Ownership table represents every card 
that every user possesses. The Card table represents every card that a user can own and query.
The Category table represents every benefit category along with the multiplier.

One user to many card ownerships.
One card ownership to one card.
One card to many categories.

Much effort was taken to normalize the data. FNF can be seen throughout the tables.
All the columns are atomic. We first started with two tables, and then we broke up the data
into four tables.

The User table columns are self-explanatory. 
The Card_Ownership table columns is also self-explanatory.
The Card table value column is the actual name of each credit card like Chase Freedom or Wells Fargo Propel.
The Category table value column is the actual category name like Gas or Dining. The multiplier column is
the number for the specific card's category reward amount like 2% or 4%.
