max_points project pitch response:

I thought this project idea was really cool. I don't have any credit cards myself, but I have an uncle who is big into having lots of credit cards and using them very systematically so that he can get all the perks that come with each card. He and his wife are always traveling and going on trips that are super cheap because of the points he gets. The only problem is, I think it is pretty time consuming, so I bet a lot of people would be interested in an application that would allow them to track all of their credit cards for them. 

Since I don't know anything about credit card points, I don't know how much I will be able to contribute to talking and planning for the features of the app, but I intend to help out where I can with that. However, I think I can contribute to the discussion on what SQL and NoSQL database will be used, as well as the eventual database design, and the user experience. 

Business: I think this project has the potential to be a really good business idea. In it's MVP stage, however, I can understand why the creator of the project would want the app to be free.

Legal: If we were hooking up users credit cards to this app, so that they could see purchases being made on the credit card, that would probably involve a little more legal work, but that won't be necessary for this class.

Technical: I think this could be a much more difficult project if the creator was intending on being able to scan a credit card and instantly retrieve all of the reward information about that credit card, but as was mentioned in his project pitch, that would probaby fall outside of the scope of this class. So other than that, the project should be relatively doable in six weeks time.
